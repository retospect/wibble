# Wibble - a template for simple python packages


A minimalist template for a python package.

Provides the bl and the blarg commands.

## Things to replace

- ```grep -ri word .``` will find the *word* in all the files
- ```find . | grep word``` will find the *word* in any filenames
- *retospect* - changed to your github user name
- *wibble* - change to the name of your project
- *wobble* - change to the internal package name you want to use 
- *fafa* - change to whatever your commandline command should be if you are providing a script
- update the pyproject.py file to have your name and the right description.
